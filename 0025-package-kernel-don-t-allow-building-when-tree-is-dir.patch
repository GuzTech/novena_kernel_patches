Subject: [PATCH 25/39] package-kernel: don't allow building when tree is dirty

When there are local changes, the package won't accurately reflect what's
in the repo.  This is a bad thing.  It also leads to version numbers with
the string -dirty appended.

If the repo has local changes, refuse to build.
