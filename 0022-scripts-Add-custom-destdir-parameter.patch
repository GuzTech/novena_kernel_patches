Subject: [PATCH 22/39] scripts: Add custom destdir parameter

We don't want packages installed to /boot since it's FAT-formatted.
Instead, our diversion script as part of U-Boot will take care of that.
As a workaround, add the KBUILD_DESTDIR variable so that users can specify
the path to place the finished kernel.
