# novena_kernel_patches
Kernel patches for the latest Linux kernel (4.13-rc6 as of this writing)

These patches were initially committed by [xobs](https://github.com/xobs/novena-linux), and modified by [sakaki-](https://github.com/sakaki-/novena-kernel-patches), and now modified again for the latest Linux kernel.

This is a work in progress since it does not build yet.
